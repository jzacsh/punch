_(a thousand lines of bash 4 without test coverage)_

== Development

.prerequisites

`make punch` to build. no tests written, yet.

== Status

Intentions: I'm currently writing this for fun on spring break, because I miss
writing code. No idea if I have any plans to ever finish this.


As of git tag `v0.payperiod.write` the `query` and `punch` and `bill`
subcommands are basically complete, and implement all the features I've actively
been utilizng in the {punchsh}[bash implementation of punch].

.TODO
. *feature*: modify NOTE on any given punch
. *e2e testing*; eg: using my {batsexec}[drop-in script `test.sh` from BATS]
