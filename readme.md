#punch

Time tracker named after old punch card time-clocks.

Punch is based on a previously writen fully funcional bash (v4) script called
punch with an sqlite3 backend. Intention of this project is to play with
node.js, socket.io and bash's file descripter interface (see `man 1 bash | LESS
+/REDIRECTION`). I'm thinking of IPC between the cli (bash script) and the web
interface (node.js) to allow for multiple interfaces for one user.
